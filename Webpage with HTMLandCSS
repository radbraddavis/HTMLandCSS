	<p style="color:white;"> I recently had the privilege of taking a trip to Tegucigalpa, Honduras for a Mission Trip. 
		I went with the expectation of seeing poverty and a society full of people who feel they got the short end of the straw in life. 
		While I did see the rampant poverty, the people that I interacted with were anything but sour about their current station in life. </p>
	
	<p style="color:White;"> While in Honduras, I had the opportunity to work with a small team to pour a concrete floor for a family. 
		This family had just received news the previous day that the man of the house (pictured in the front row in the center) 
		had oral cancer and that there wasn’t anything that we could do for him. While this would send many people into a spiral, 
		this family still seemed to have joy in their lives. They were living in unsanitary conditions and this part of their home still had a dirt floor. 
		They were happy for what they had and what we were doing for them. They weren’t concerned with their wants, just their needs. </p>

	<p style="color:White;"> I was also offered the opportunity to work with children outside of one of our work sites. I was able to sing and dance with the 
		kids before washing hair and treating for lice. These kids had true joy in their lives. They lived in the moment, which allowed them to really 
		participate in what was going on. All of them had smiles on their faces and seemed to feel like they were on top of the world. I was able to show 
		them the love of God by simply being with them and treating them like the wonderful creations they are.</p> 

	<p style="color:White;"> This trip has truly caused me to reexamine what my priorities in life are. If all I do is work and worry about what may happen 
		later in life, I have all the focus on myself and what I want, not what I actually need. Joy in life doesn’t come from possessions but from 
		relationships. We can always learn from others and we should never feel that we are superior to anyone else. With my focus readjusted, life is 
		looking a little simpler and a much more satisfying. </p>
